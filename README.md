# second-project

This project was intended to foster people's creativity, by both enabling audio and visual experience.

We worked together with my classmate Ioav on this project: while he was primarily focused on the Freesound API, I was mainly working on the Web Audio API.

The part of the code I'm the most proud of is managing to combine 2 different effects from the Web Audio API, the decoder (i.e. that enables you to change the speed of a song) and the analyser (that enables you to get a visual representation of the sound), while you are editing it.
It was quite an achievement for me because sound editing is already hard to understand (without even coding!), i.e. to understand all the sounds properties etc. Moreover, the Web Audio API has a specific way of functionning (with nodes), that I was happy to discover.
